== Synopsis
The Price Threshold Application is responsible for registration of article price thresholds. A threshold is defined by a value and an indicator for the type of threshold (upperbound or lower bound). When an article price changes, this price might cross a threshold. If the price change is crossing an upper- or lower bound in the indicated direction of a price threshold, this must result in an event.

= Kafka Streams project

Goal of the project is to be able to handle a stream of article price change events. The events arrive per second. The project will support a limited amount of articles (~50).

Customers have set price boundaries (upper and lower bound) and want to receive a message when a product price crosses one of the boundaries. It must result in different messages.
The number of customers to support is unlimited and every customer can set an number of upper bounds and any number of lower bounds per article.

== Design
One of the goals of the project is to experiment with ksqlDB and kafka streams.

The price changes are received as one JSON document. The Kafka client will split the JSON into separate events and publishes the event to topics, one topic per article.

A ksqlDB table will store the current prices.

The current prices are matched with the boundary values set by customers to find the customers who need a notification.
